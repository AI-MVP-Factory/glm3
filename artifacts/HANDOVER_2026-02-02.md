# Session Handover - 2026-02-02

## Session Summary

**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Project:** GLM3 - Strategic Coordinator
**Session Focus:** Project state assessment + Z.AI connection fix

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Z.AI Connection Issue ✅
- **Problem:** Clone sessions in `/dev/glm/` through `/dev/glm6/` were failing with "token expired or incorrect" error
- **Root Cause:** Confusion between opus-router (which routes `opus` to Anthropic OAuth) vs direct Z.AI connection
- **Solution:** All GLM folders now have `.claude/settings.json` pointing directly to `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`
- **Action Required:** Users need to restart Claude Code app for those folders to pick up new settings

**Fixed Config:** (all `.claude/settings.json` files now point directly to Z.AI)
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "<Z.AI_API_TOKEN>",
    "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000"
  },
  "model": "opus",
  "outputStyle": "default"
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Project State Assessment 📊

Parallel agents gathered complete picture of:
- GLM3 strategy documentation (17 specs, 6,223 lines)
- Factory status (ORDERS.json, STATUS.json)
- SOLO V5 portfolio (31 apps scaffolded, viral trio at 80-95% readiness)
- Design system (complete documentation, needs implementation)
- Archived signal scanner (why archived, should not rebuild)

---

## Current State of Key Projects

### Factory System (/Users/p/dev/mvps/)
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ORDERS.json | 3 orders queued | taskflow-v3 (CRITICAL), teenpoptastic, memecraftvibe |
| STATUS.json | 0% progress | Factory operational but not actively building |
| Services | 3 exist | morning-brief, ops-agent, scoring-engine |
| Workers | Not running | Need activation |

### SOLO V5 (/Users/p/dev/solo-v5/)
| App | Readiness | Domain |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| The Final Tab | 80% | thefinaltab.io |
| Nostalgia Cam | 90% | nostalgiacam.io |
| HateDelete | 95% | hatedelete.io |

**Blocker:** All technical work complete, needs deployment activation

### GLM3 Strategy (/Users/p/dev/glm3/artifacts/strategy/)
- ✅ SOLO_BUSINESS_VISION - Complete
- ✅ SPEC_01: Business Dashboard
- ✅ SPEC_02: Signal Scanner
- ✅ SPEC_03: AI Scoring Engine
- ✅ SPEC_04: Ops AI Agent
- ✅ SPEC_05: Morning Brief Generator
- ✅ Architecture, Deployment, Security, Cost docs

**Gap:** Strategy documented but not implemented (and some components already exist elsewhere)

## THE CRITICAL WARNING 🚨

> **"DO YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST - Always research what exists before building"**

**Previous Session Mistake:** Rebuilt components that already existed (Signal Scanner, Scoring Engine, Morning Brief). Result: "A mess, cannot use it now."

**Archived Components:**
- `~/.archived/signal-scanner.archive-20260129_132017/` - Archived because v3_signal_scanner already exists with SearXNG integration
- v3 system writes directly to Brain's signals_raw table
- **Do NOT reactivate the archived version**

---

## 50 Most Valuable Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE (Today) - Infrastructure & Decisions
1. **Investigate v3_signal_scanner status** - Is it running? If not, why?
2. **Check factory worker activation** - Which workers should be running?
3. **Decide: Ship SOLO V5 apps or build factory intelligence first?**
4. **Restart Claude Code sessions** for glm/glm2/glm4/glm5/glm6 to pick up Z.AI config
5. **Ingest this session to Brain** - `/learn/session` after commit

### SOLO V5 SHIP (Fastest Revenue) - 3-7 days
6. Deploy The Final Tab to production (thefinaltab.io)
7. Deploy Nostalgia Cam to production (nostalgiacam.io)
8. Deploy HateDelete to production (hatedelete.io)
9. Set up Stripe payment links for all three
10. Create landing page copy (96% emotional threshold)
11. Launch App Store submission for iOS versions
12. Set up basic analytics (PostHog or Plausible)
13. Create launch announcement for Product Hunt
14. Test payment flows end-to-end
15. Set up customer support email/feedback system

### FACTORY INTELLIGENCE (Auto-Business) - 5-17 days
16. Verify v3_signal_scanner is operational
17. Check Brain API /entities, /insights, /wisdom endpoints
18. Create scored.jsonl → ORDERS.json integration
19. Build Business Dashboard (Grafana) - SPEC_01
20. Implement Morning Brief Generator - SPEC_05
21. Create Ops AI Agent escalation rules - SPEC_04
22. Set up 24/7 monitoring for all services
23. Test end-to-end: Signal → Score → Dashboard → Order → Build
24. Define "Morning Coffee Workflow" UI mockup
25. Document founder decision criteria (Go/No-Go thresholds)

### TASKFLOW-V3 BUILD (Critical Priority) - 17+ days
26. Phase 1: Web App (17 features)
27. Phase 2: iOS App (15 features)
28. Phase 3: Mac App (10 features)
29. Define "beat Things 3" success criteria
30. Set up TaskFlow project in factory
31. Create TaskFlow design system (use existing glm3/design/)
32. Build core task management features
33. Implement drag/drop with visual feedback
34. Add keyboard shortcuts (power user features)
35. Test emotional value: Does it feel delightful?

### DESIGN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION - 4-8 days
36. Set up Tailwind CSS with design tokens
37. Implement card components (Task, Profile, Notification)
38. Implement button components with animations
39. Implement loading components (skeletons, progress bars)
40. Create Storybook for component documentation
41. Test components across all three product variants
42. Extract colors to CSS variables
43. Ensure OLED-optimized colors work correctly

### BRAIN API OPTIMIZATION - 2-5 days
44. Audit Brain API usage (485K+ records)
45. Implement /insights endpoint for candidate scoring
46. Implement /wisdom endpoint for founder decisions
47. Set up LanceDB query optimization
48. Add multimodal image search via Qwen3-VL-Embedding
49. Create Brain-to-Factory signal pipeline
50. Document Brain API capabilities for workers

### STRATEGIC DECISIONS NEEDED
- **Ship to Learn vs Factory First:** Should we launch V5 apps to validate market, or build intelligence layer first?
- **Signal Scanner:** Reactivate v3 or build enhanced version?
- **Worker Fleet:** Which workers should run 24/7?
- **Resource Allocation:** Mac (orchestrator), Alienware (Brain), PC (workers) - is this optimal?
